# T2B-framework

Hi @Pielco11 here,
so this is my first project, I'm not so skilled so please be patient for my bugs.

##News 21/04/16
Created v1 because reinvent the wheel is helpful but not useful.
So added ssl support to make a sense of real security. At the time of writing I'm using ssl std lib., but if there is a why that I shouldn't use it please tell me (this is not my field).

##Description
Merge the power of Python with the anonymity of Tor.
This project aim to create a composite network of connected hosts. The main categories are:

 + bots (T-client)
 + headquarters (TM-server)
 + *boxes* (version =< 0.1)

Trust&safe connections with **AES** and **HMAC**.

This is just the beginning so you can't expect nothing special.

##Motivation
Started looking for one... ended up writing one.

##Installation
Not needed, just download and edit with **Your** own settings.

##Contributors
I found a lot of code all over the web, so as soon as possible I'll add the reference to the main authors.
Last but not least, many people inspired me but citing everyone will crush the net.

##Known Bugs
- [ ] slow transfer while down/up-loading throuth Tor (*this is why I created boxes*)
- [-] using a master key (solved, just for beta)
- [ ] ...let me know 

##Abuse
I'm **NOT** responsible for damages did by the abuse of this software.
