Added **s-wifi** that let you to scan the remote Wifi network;\r\n   2. Added **info** that let you retrieve some information about the target, like IP address and other OS information;\r\n* 21/04/16:\r\nCreated v1 because reinvent the wheel is helpful but not useful.\r\nSo added **TLS**/**SSL** support to make a sense of real security. At the time of writing I'm using ssl std lib., but if there is a why that I shouldn't use it please tell me (this is not my field).\r\n\r\n##Description\r\nMerge the power of Python with the anonymity of Tor.\r\nThis project aim to create a composite network of connected hosts. The main categories are:\r\n\r\n + bots (T-client)\r\n + headquarters (TM-server)\r\n + *boxes* (version =< 0.1)\r\n\r\nTrust&safe connections with **AES** and **HMAC**.\r\n\r\nThis is just the beginning so you can't expect nothing special.\r\n\r\n##Motivation\r\nStarted looking for one... ended up writing one.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n* Install GEOIP2, and download the database\r\n* Install colored and clint\r\n* Install wifi to scan the remote wifi area\r\n\r\n##Contributors\r\nI found a lot of code all over the web, so as soon as possible I'll add the reference to the main authors.\r\nLast but not least, many people inspired me but citing everyone will crush the net.\r\n\r\n##Known Bugs\r\n- [-] using a master key (solved, just for beta)\r\n- [ ] ...let me know \r\n\r\n##Abuse\r\nI'm **NOT** responsible for damages did by the abuse of this software.\r\n\r\n##Contact me\r\nYou can find me on Twitter or you can add me on Ricochet ricochet:cuu6hyttxg66ew6n.\r\n\r\n",
