  "body": "# T2B-framework\r\n> Merge the power of Python with the anonymity of Tor.\r\n\r\n##News\r\n* 05/05/16:\r\n   1. Added **s-wifi** that let you to scan the remote Wifi network;\r\n   2. Added **info** that let you retrieve some information about the target, like IP address and other OS information;\r\n* 21/04/16:\r\nCreated v1 because reinvent the wheel is helpful but not useful.\r\nSo added **TLS**/**SSL** support to make a sense of real security. At the time of writing I'm using ssl std lib., but if there is a why that I shouldn't use it please tell me.\r\n\r\n##Description\r\nThis project aims to administrate a network of compromised hosts, keeping your identity private (thanks to Tor) and your connections secure (thanks to TLS/SSL). For many times botnets get stuck because the main servers became compromised, but this framework will let you keep yours C&C safe and alive (well, this will do its best).\r\n\r\n1. T-master\r\n2. T-client\r\n3. Firewall (soon)\r\n\r\n##Motivation\r\nStarted looking for one... ended up writing one.\r\n\r\n##Requirements\r\n* Linux (soon Windows and OS X)\r\n* Python 2.7\r\n* [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and a HS.\r\n* [Clint: Python Command-line Application Tools](https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint)\r\n* [Colored](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colored)\r\n* [GeoIP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geoip2) and the [DB](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/)\r\n* [Wifi, a Python interface](https://wifi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\r\n* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to [generate Private Key and Cert](https://msol.io/blog/tech/create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-with-openssl/)\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n* Install Tor and initialize a HS\r\n* Generate a S.S.C. (Self-Signed-Certificate) with Openssl (you can use the priv key of the HS)\r\n* Modify the variables of the S.C. as you like (host, port, etc..)\r\n* Install GEOIP2, and download the database\r\n* Install colored and clint\r\n* Install wifi to scan the remote wifi area\r\n\r\n##Contributors\r\nI found a lot of code all over the web, so as soon as possible I'll add the reference to the main authors.\r\nLast but not least, many people inspired me but citing everyone will crush the net.\r\n\r\n##Known Bugs\r\n* wifi card in s-scan (see code..)\r\n\r\n##Abuse\r\nI'm **NOT** responsible for damages did by the abuse of this software.\r\n\r\n##Contact me\r\nYou can find me on Twitter or you can add me on [Ricochet](https://ricochet.im/) ricochet:cuu6hyttxg66ew6n.\r\n\r\n",
