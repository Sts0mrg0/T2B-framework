# T-pybot

Hi @Pielco11 here,
so this is my first project, I'm not so skilled so please be patient for my bugs.

##Description
Merge the power of Python with the anonymity of Tor.
This project aim to create a composite network of connected hosts. The main categories are:

 + bots (T-client)
 + headquarter (TM-server)
 + *boxes* (soon)

This will be not just a *classic* botnet, this will be bulletproof network.
Trust&safe connections, the power of **AES** and **HMAC** give data-level encryption.
A distribuited series of headquarters makes more complicted and difficult to track down the net.

This is just the beginning so you can't expect nothing special.

##Motivation
Started looking for one... ended up writing one.

##Installation
Not needed, just download and edit with **Your** own settings.

##Contributors
I found a lot of code all over the web, so as soon as possible I'll add the reference to the main authors.
Last but not least, many people inspired me but citing everyone will crush the net.

##Known Bugs
 1. slow transfer while down/up-loading throuth Tor (*this is why I created boxes*)
 2. ...let me know 

##Abuse
I'm **NOT** responsible for damages did by the abuse of this software.
